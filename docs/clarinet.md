# Clarinetists of the world, rise up! You have nothing to lose but your airy tone!

I have played the clarinet since February of 2018, and over the years I have gained a bit of a reputation for being loud. Recently (more specifically, Friday, October 20, 2023), I also gained a reputation for bringing a traffic cone to our high school's homecoming game and playing into it.

## Song recs

Along the way, I also incidentally played a few songs. Here are some of my favorites:

- English Folk Song Suite by Ralph Vaughan Williams
- Concerto for Clarinet by Artie Shaw
- Bruckner's 8th Symphony: Finale by Anton Bruckner
- Societe Blue by Andrew David Perkins
- Still Fly by Southern University Marching Band (one of the best YouTube videos of all time)
- In Taberna Quando Sumus, a raucous drinking movement of the epic Carmina Burana
- ... and many others!
