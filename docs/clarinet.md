# Clarinetists of the world, rise up! You have nothing to lose but your airy tone!

I have played the clarinet since February of 2018, and over the years I have gained a bit of a reputation for being loud. Recently (more specifically, Friday, October 20, 2023), I also gained a reputation for bringing a traffic cone to our high school's homecoming game and playing into it.

## Song recs

Along the way, I also incidentally played a few songs. Here are some of my favorites:

- English Folk Song Suite by Ralph Vaughan Williams
- Concerto for Clarinet by Artie Shaw
- Bruckner's 8th Symphony: Finale by Anton Bruckner
- Societe Blue by Andrew David Perkins
- Still Fly by Southern University Marching Band (one of the best YouTube videos of all time)
- In Taberna Quando Sumus, a raucous drinking movement of the epic Carmina Burana
- ... and many others!

## To blast, or not to blast (a parody soliloquy by myself)

### To blast, or not to blast: that is the question:
### Whether 'tis nobler in the band to unleash
### The screaming notes of O Fortuna,
### Or to bow down to a sea of haters,
### And by silence obey them? To quiet: to play 
### No more; and by a pause to say I end
### The ear-ache and the thousand-decibel pangs
### That pierce the air through, in every composition.
### This, some devoutly wish. To pause, to play soft;
### To play soft: perchance to be lost: ay, there's the rub;
### For in that silence what brassy instruments may come
### When the clarinets play quietly for a while,
### Must give us pause; there's the suspect
### That makes us clarinets play loud and high;
### For who would hear the tenor's audacious crimes
### (The notes flat or wrong), the percussion untimely,
### The screech of despised flutes, the trumpet's high A,
### The insolence of altos and the spurns
### That us clarinets of the Bâ™­ take;
### When we ourselves might our quietness break
### With some mere blasting? Who would French horns bear,
### And cover our ears under trombones' leering smiles?
### But that threat of loud clarinets,
### The unparalleled army whose wall of sound
### Every musician fears, shall strengthen our will;
### No more shall we bear the trumpet bells we hate;
### For our Still Fly they know not of.
### Conscience shall no more make cowards of us all;
### And the bright, jazzy, chord resolutions
### (Formerly sicklied o'er with sounds pale and fraught)
### Shall become enterprises of great pith and moment.
### With this regard our bells turn towards the sky,
### And play in the name of action.
