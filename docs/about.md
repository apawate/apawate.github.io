# About

I'm a senior in high school at Lynbrook HS in San Jose, California, interested in majoring in electrical engineering at a research university. I'm a National Merit Semifinalist and a winner of MIT's prestigious [THINK research competition](https://think.mit.edu)! My research project focuses on using low-cost phased array ultrasonic mapping in disaster relief zones, coupled with SLAM and multivariate regression in order to estimate odometry and reduce noise. This excites me because I'm an avid biker and runner, so anything to protect the areas that I explore is something I'm passionate about.
I also like to play my clarinet loudly and frequently. I even played a traffic cone on my clarinet once; you can read about that elsewhere on the site.

Thanks for visiting, and have fun exploring my website!
