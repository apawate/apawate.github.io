# About

### Myself

I'm a junior in high school at Lynbrook HS in San Jose, California. I do software for [Lynbrook Robotics, FRC Team 846](https://github.com/Team846) and am also a part of the cross country and track teams. Some current [projects](https://apawate.github.io/projects) I'm working on include a game piece detection program for my robotics team as well as a project as a finalist in the [THINK program](https://think.mit.edu) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

### Website

As of February 2023, this website has been rewritten. It will house docs for my code projects (particularly MIT THINK) and additional, miscellaneous interesting stuff as well!
