# About

### Myself

I'm a junior in high school at Lynbrook HS in San Jose, California and a winner of MIT's prestigious [THINK research competition](https://think.mit.edu)! My research project focuses on using low-cost phased array ultrasonic mapping in disaster relief zones, coupled with SLAM and multivariate regression in order to estimate odometry and reduce noise.

### Website

As of February 2023, this website has been rewritten. It will house docs for my code projects (particularly MIT THINK) and additional, miscellaneous interesting stuff as well!
