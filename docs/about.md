# About

I'm a sophomore in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. While originally from Urbana-Champaign, I spent most of my formative years in Silicon Valley and attended Lynbrook High School in San Jose, CA. In high school, I was a National Merit Semifinalist and a winner of MIT's prestigious [THINK research competition](https://think.mit.edu)! My research project for THINK focused on using low-cost phased array ultrasonic mapping in disaster relief zones. This excites me because I'm an avid biker and runner, so anything to protect the areas that I explore is something I'm passionate about.

At UIUC, I've had the opportunity to be the minibots lead for our Class of 2028 combat robotics team, which has been a great experience overall. Furthermore, I've also had the chance to be involved in both of UIUC's major robotics organizations, iRobotics and Robobrawl, as the Internal Publicity Director and Communications director, respectively. Inevitably, I also ended up designing a combat robot along with Maya Cheshire for antweight robotics competitions around the Midwest and California. You can find out about both of those things under my new [Robotics](https://apawate.github.io/robotics) page. 

I also like to play my clarinet loudly and frequently. I even played a traffic cone on my clarinet once; you can read about that elsewhere on the site.

Thanks for visiting, and have fun exploring my website!
