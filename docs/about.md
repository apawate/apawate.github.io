### Myself

I'm a senior in high school at Lynbrook HS in San Jose, California and a winner of MIT's prestigious [THINK research competition](https://think.mit.edu)! My research project focuses on using low-cost phased array ultrasonic mapping in disaster relief zones, coupled with SLAM and multivariate regression in order to estimate odometry and reduce noise.

### This site

This site is mainly just a way for me to post interesting stuff about my projects online, including MIT THINK (once I finish it, of course).
