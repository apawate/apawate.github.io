# About me

I am a ninth grader at Lynbrook High School in San Jose, California. I've been coding since fourth grade, when my dad gave me a book on Python.

I got an Arduino for my birthday that year, and the rest was history. I spent hours coding, tinkering, soldering, making - doing whatever I wanted. In fourth grade, I joined a team of high schoolers in the Champaign-Urbana CUMake program and won second place in the basic category. In fifth grade, I went solo and got second place in the advanced category.

Once I moved to the Bay Area in sixth grade, I began to put my skills to use even more. I won the "Best Robotics Project" award at my middle school's Tech Expo that year for my ultrasonic sensor-powered "invisible" piano.

In seventh grade, me and a few teammates participated in the competition for SEARCH (Science Enrichment And ResearCH) class at Miller Middle School, which was a business class that put our skills to the test to design a product and pitch it. Our product, an ultrasonic-sensor mapping device for firefighters called Echo, was a huge success - we ended up winning the competition handily thanks to our dedication and team spirit. We even visited local fire stations to get ideas and pointers on how we could improve our solution.

Nowadays, I code for my robotics team [Team 846](https://lynbrookrobotics.com) and participate in the Lynbrook CS and ML clubs. Thanks to my software and computer science skills, I now have opportunities I could have only dreamed of a few years ago, a bounty of experience ready to be put to use, and a way to express my ideas and creativity.
