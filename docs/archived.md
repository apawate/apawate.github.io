# Archived projects

### Skparab1 Pacman
A PacMan game with [skparab1](https://github.com/skparab1) and many other very cool people, all from LHS. Play [here](https://skparab1.github.io) and feel free to fork and contribute!

### Set Game
The [set game](https://github.com/apawate/Python3-Set-Game-2021) is now public! After a long hiatus, development will restart - first, primarily focusing on the [nightmare bug](https://github.com/apawate/Python3-Set-Game-2021/commit/b8bce2027e9d09ca5446327035736ee4e18524b0), which (despite me saying otherwise in the link) is still not completely fixed.
