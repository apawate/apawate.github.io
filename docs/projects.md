### Dog

[Dog](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216/dog) is a tool for Unix-based systems that emulates `cat`, except with syntax highlighting and other features. It currently supports C, Python, Java, XML, JSON and others. I developed it with [@HuangPatrick16777216](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216).
