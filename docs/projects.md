# My Projects

### Echo
My [MIT THINK](https://think.mit.edu) project for 2023, which was ultimately selected as one of six finalists out of a field of over 300 proposals. Will be developed and published (prototype in June) with help from the THINK program. More information (as well as a dedicated page) coming soon...

### Game Piece Detection for FRC 2023
Currently writing code to detect cones and cubes in the FRC 2023 game and figure out a vector to them.  

### Who Won?
An [open-source finish camera](https://github.com/apawate/whowon) for track and cross-country meets in partnership with [Adarsh Iyer](https://github.com/adarshramiyer).
