### Set Game
The [set game](https://github.com/apawate/Python3-Set-Game-2021) is now public! After a long hiatus, development will restart - first, primarily focusing on the [nightmare bug](https://github.com/apawate/Python3-Set-Game-2021/commit/b8bce2027e9d09ca5446327035736ee4e18524b0), which (despite me saying otherwise in the link) is still not completely fixed.
