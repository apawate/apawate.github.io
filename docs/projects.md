# My Projects


### Piano Video

[Piano Video](https://github.com/apawate/graphsciics) is a free, open-source tool for creating piano video simulations. Working on this with [Patrick](github.com/phuang1024).

### Set Game
The [set game](https://github.com/apawate/Python3-Set-Game-2021) is now public! After a long hiatus, development will restart - first, primarily focusing on the [nightmare bug](https://github.com/apawate/Python3-Set-Game-2021/commit/b8bce2027e9d09ca5446327035736ee4e18524b0), which (despite me saying otherwise in the link) is still not completely fixed.
