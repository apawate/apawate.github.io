### Hello!

### I'm a 9th grader with avid interests in many aspects of coding.

#### Here's some things I'm doing:
  - Coding the [game of Set](https://github.com/apawate/Python3-Set-Game-2021) in Python (for my Computer Programming class in high school)
    - The repo is private for now (I don't want other classmates stealing the code) but I'll make it public once I finish. *Update: Projects are graded and I also have feedback, but still can't release as of 5/7.*
    - Currently, I'm trying to make it multiplayer in real-time over the internet, which is hard. There's one bug which keeps popping up - I almost have it squashed, but it still appears under some circumstances...
  - Working on software for my robotics team, [@Team846](https://github.com/Team846) 
  - Slowly improving my [**ASCII Hangman**](https://github.com/apawate/ascii-hangman) game
  - Working on [**Dog**](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216/dog), a better version of Unix `cat`, with [@HuangPatrick16777216](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216), whose idea it was and who has coded nearly everything so far

#### Active repos:
  - [**Set Game**](https://github.com/apawate/Python3-Set-Game-2021): Basic functionality is good for the most part, and it can (almost) be played in realtime over the internet. Just waiting until I have the green light from my CS teacher to make it public...
  - [**ASCII Hangman**](https://github.com/apawate/ascii-hangman): Something interesting I made in just over an hour. A simple game of hangman using ASCII characters and Python. 
  - _**New**_ [**Dog**](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216/dog): Like the Unix command `cat`, except with cool stuff like syntax highlighting (because dogs are cooler than cats). Collaborating with [@HuangPatrick16777216](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216), to whom all the credit goes since he had the idea and has coded nearly all of it.
