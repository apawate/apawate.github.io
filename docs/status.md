# Here's some things I'm doing:
  - Creating a Python ASCII graphics library, [GraphSCIIcs](https://github.com/apawate/graphsciics). Version 0.0.1 is now out, with basic support for rectangles. More will come soon. It is available via PyPI and `pip install graphsciics`.
  - Coding the [game of Set](https://github.com/apawate/Python3-Set-Game-2021) in Python (for my Computer Programming class in high school)
    - The repo is private for now (I don't want other classmates stealing the code) but I'll make it public once I finish. *Update: Projects are graded and I also have feedback, but still can't release as of 5/7.*
    - Currently, I'm trying to make it multiplayer in real-time over the internet, which is hard. There's one bug which keeps popping up - I almost have it squashed, but it still appears under some circumstances...
  - Working on software for my robotics team, [@Team846](https://github.com/Team846) 
  - Slowly improving my [**ASCII Hangman**](https://github.com/apawate/ascii-hangman) game
  - Working on [**Dog**](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216/dog), a better version of Unix `cat`, with [@HuangPatrick16777216](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216), whose idea it was and who has coded nearly everything so far


# Project statuses

### Set

Waiting for [my CS teacher](https://github.com/psmaker) to approve me releasing it as of 5/14. It was originally developed for my CS project this year. It comes with features such as realtime multiplayer modes over the internet!

### Dog

Patrick is currently developing an [abstract syntax tree](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216/python-east) for Dog to make it better. Unfortunately, this will erase a lot of the code I wrote (but will keep the easter egg).


### GraphSCIIcs

Currently developing it. The version out, 0.0.1, has basic support for rectangles. I will add support for other shapes as well as colors later on.
