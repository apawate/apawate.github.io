# Here's some things I'm doing:
  - Creating a Python ASCII graphics library, [GraphSCIIcs](https://github.com/apawate/graphsciics). Version 0.0.3 is now out, with basic support for rectanglesand custom shapes. It also can do animation. More features will come soon, such as colors. It is available via PyPI and `pip install graphsciics`.
  - Coding the [game of Set](https://github.com/apawate/Python3-Set-Game-2021) in Python (for my Computer Programming class in high school)
    - The repo is now **public**! Contribute by forking and creating a pull-request, or you can talk to me at school and I'll add you as a contributor (if you are also a Lynbrook student). 
    - Currently, I'm trying to make it multiplayer in real-time over the internet, which is hard. There's one bug which keeps popping up - I almost have it squashed, but it still appears under some circumstances...
  - Working on software for my robotics team, [@Team846](https://github.com/Team846) 
  - Slowly improving my [**ASCII Hangman**](https://github.com/apawate/ascii-hangman) game
  - Working on [**Dog**](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216/dog), a better version of Unix `cat`, with [@HuangPatrick16777216](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216), whose idea it was and who has coded nearly everything so far


# Project statuses

### Set

**The game of set is now public!** Contribute by forking and making a pull request, or asking me at school (if you're a Lynbrook student) to be added directly as a contributor. It was originally developed for my CS project this year. It comes with features such as realtime multiplayer modes over the internet!

### Dog

Patrick is currently developing an [abstract syntax tree](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216/python-east) for Dog to make it better. Unfortunately, this will erase a lot of the code I wrote (but will keep the easter egg).


### GraphSCIIcs

Currently developing it. The version out, 0.0.3, has basic support for rectangles, custom shapes and animation. I will add support for other shapes as well as colors later on. It is available on PyPI: `pip install graphsciics`
