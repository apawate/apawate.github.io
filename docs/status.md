# Here's some things I'm doing:
  - Coding the [game of Set](https://github.com/apawate/Python3-Set-Game-2021) in Python (for my Computer Programming class in high school)
    - The repo is now **public**! Contribute by forking and creating a pull-request, or you can talk to me at school and I'll add you as a contributor (if you are also a Lynbrook student). 
    - Currently, I'm trying to make it multiplayer in real-time over the internet, which is hard. There's one bug which keeps popping up - I almost have it squashed, but it still appears under some circumstances...
  - Working on software for my robotics team, [@Team846](https://github.com/Team846) 
  - Slowly improving my [**ASCII Hangman**](https://github.com/apawate/ascii-hangman) game
  - Working on [**Piano Video**](https://github.com/apawate/piano_video), a piano video simulation tool, with [Patrick](https://github.com/phuang1024), whose idea it was and who has coded nearly everything so far


# Project statuses

### Set

**The game of set is now public!** Contribute by forking and making a pull request, or asking me at school (if you're a Lynbrook student) to be added directly as a contributor. It was originally developed for my CS project this year. It comes with features such as realtime multiplayer modes over the internet!






### Piano Video

Working on the project with Patrick. I did some stuff around the smoke simulation and am now looking for more holes, though I doubt if there are many left.
