# Project statuses

### Set

Currently waiting for [my CS teacher](https://github.com/psmaker) to approve me releasing it as of 5/14. It was originally developed for my CS project this year. It comes with features such as realtime multiplayer modes over the internet!

### Dog

Patrick is currently developing an [abstract syntax tree](https://github.com/HuangPatrick16777216/python-east) for Dog to make it better. Unfortunately, this will erase a lot of the code I wrote (but will keep the easter egg).
