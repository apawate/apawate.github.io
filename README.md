### Hello!
###
### I'm a 9th grader with avid interests in many aspects of coding.
###

#### Here's some things I'm doing:
  - Coding the game of Set in Python (for my Computer Programming class in high school)
    - The repo is private for now (I don't want other classmates stealing the code) but I'll make it public once I finish. *Update: Projects are graded and I also have feedback, but still can't release as of 5/7.*
    - Currently, I'm trying to make it multiplayer in real-time over the internet, which is hard. There's one bug which keeps popping up - I almost have it squashed, but it still appears under some circumstances...
  - Working on software for my robotics team, @Team846 
  - Slowly improving my **ASCII Hangman** game
  - Working on **Dog**, a better version of Unix `cat`, with @HuangPatrick16777216, whose idea it was and who has coded nearly everything so far

#### Active repos:
  - **Set Game**: Basic functionality is good for the most part, and it can (almost) be played in realtime over the internet. Just waiting until I have the green light from my CS teacher to make it public...
  - **ASCII Hangman**: Something interesting I made in just over an hour. A simple game of hangman using ASCII characters and Python. 
  - _**New**_ **Dog**: Like the Unix command `cat`, except with cool stuff like syntax highlighting (because dogs are cooler than cats). Collaborating with @HuangPatrick16777216, to whom all the credit goes since he had the idea and has coded nearly all of it.
